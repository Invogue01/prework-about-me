      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>The short version of where I am from is from Birmingham. 
        And the long version (if you got time) is that I was born in Birmingham but when my parents devorced we went to live to Lithuania and I came back to UK in 2006.</p>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Birmingham on the outskirts of Bournville with my two cats Frida and Ivy. Oh and I almost forgot, my husband Robbie lives with us too.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>All my life I was very interested in Computers and Internet in general. But like for many of us life doesnt always work out the way we want (I have moved countries twice).
        Now, finaly, I am able to follow my dream and learn coding!
        I dont have a specific answer to Why web development in particular. But I think this is a great place to start! Dont you?
